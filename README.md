#My Coding Pal
My Coding Pal is a full stack JavaScript application with a Vue framework, an Express server and MongoDB database.

##The Project Brief
The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive browser applications that display information in a fun and interesting way. Your task is to make an a Minimum Viable Product or prototype to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app.

The seed questions focus on the topic of coding, though the app can be used for any topic.

A user should be able to:
view some educational content on a particular topic
be able to interact with the page to move through different sections of content
